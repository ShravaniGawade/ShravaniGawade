## About Me
I’m a Data Analyst and Applied Data Science graduate student at San Jose State University, graduating in December 2025 (GPA 4.0). I am passionate about using data, algorithms and AI to solve real-world problems. With a background in Computer Science and Management, I bring a blend of technical depth and business acumen aligned for roles in Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Generative AI.

With hands-on experience in FinTech and HRTech, I have built machine learning models to predict employee attrition, designed real-time dashboards for high-volume transaction monitoring, and standardized enterprise data pipelines resulting in improvements in data quality, operational efficiency, and decision-making across functions.
